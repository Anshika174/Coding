This repository contains my practice work and mini-projects in Java, SQL, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
It includes solutions to programming exercises, database queries, and frontend development experiments.
The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, backend logic building, and UI design capabilities.
